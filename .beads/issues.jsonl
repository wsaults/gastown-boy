{"id":"gb-4gfc","title":"Add rig context and selector to UI","description":"## Summary\nAdd rig context to the Gastown Boy UI so users can see which rig each item belongs to, with an optional filter to narrow down to a specific rig.\n\n## Problem\nCurrently the UI shows data without rig context. Users managing multiple rigs cannot:\n- Tell which rig a mail message or crew member belongs to\n- Optionally filter to focus on one rig\n\n## Design Principles\n- **Default is ALL rigs** - User wants to see everything at once\n- **Rig shown inline** - Each item displays its rig context\n- **Filter is secondary** - Optional dropdown to narrow focus\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Inline Rig Labels (Primary)\n- Each mail message shows rig badge (e.g., \"[GASTOWN]\" or \"[GASTOWN_BOY]\")\n- Each crew member shows their rig affiliation\n- Power screen shows all rigs' status in a unified view\n- Use color coding or badges to distinguish rigs visually\n\n### 2. Optional Rig Filter (Secondary)\n- Small dropdown in header or screen corner: \"All Rigs\" | \"gastown\" | \"gastown_boy\"\n- Defaults to \"All Rigs\" on load\n- When filtered, only show items from that rig\n- Persist filter preference in localStorage (optional)\n\n### 3. Visual Design\n- Rig badges should match Pip-Boy aesthetic\n- Consider color-coding rigs (e.g., gastown=cyan, gastown_boy=amber)\n- Keep badges compact to not clutter the UI\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Mail messages have `to` field with rig path (e.g., \"gastown_boy/carl\")\n- Status API returns `rigs` array with all rig data\n- Filter can be client-side (no backend changes needed)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Default view shows ALL rigs (no filtering on initial load)\n- [ ] Mail messages display rig badge inline (extracted from to/from address)\n- [ ] Crew members display their rig affiliation\n- [ ] Power screen shows status for all rigs in unified view\n- [ ] Optional filter dropdown available (defaults to \"All Rigs\")\n- [ ] Filtering to specific rig works correctly\n- [ ] Rig badges are visually distinct and match Pip-Boy aesthetic\n- [ ] UI remains uncluttered with inline rig context","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-13T12:35:44.95292-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-13T13:05:12.262841-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-13T13:05:12.262841-06:00","close_reason":"Implemented rig context badges and filter.

{"id":"gb-8h1","title":"Support rig-specific beads databases in UI","description":"## Overview\n\nWhen a rig is selected in the RigFilter dropdown, the beads tab should fetch from that rig's beads database instead of town-level beads.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- Backend always queries town-level beads (`~/gt/.beads/`)\n- Frontend groups beads by rig AFTER fetching (cosmetic only)\n- RigFilter infrastructure exists but isn't used by BeadsList\n\n## Desired Behavior\n- When 'gastown_boy' rig selected → fetch from `~/Projects/Saults/gastown-boy/.beads/` (prefix: gb-)\n- When 'gastown' rig selected → fetch from `~/gt/gastown/.beads/`\n- When no rig selected → fetch from town-level beads (prefix: hq-)\n\n---\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Backend: beads-service.ts\n\n**File:** `backend/src/services/beads-service.ts`\n\n**Current code (lines 125-126):**\n```typescript\nconst townRoot = resolveTownRoot();\nconst beadsDir = resolveBeadsDir(townRoot);  // Always town-level\n```\n\n**Changes needed:**\n\nA. Update `ListBeadsOptions` interface (line 30-35):\n```typescript\nexport interface ListBeadsOptions {\n  rig?: string;      // existing - filters results\n  rigPath?: string;  // NEW - path to rig's beads database\n  status?: string;\n  type?: string;\n  limit?: number;\n}\n```\n\nB. Update `listBeads()` function:\n```typescript\nexport async function listBeads(options: ListBeadsOptions = {}): Promise\u003cBeadsServiceResult\u003cBeadInfo[]\u003e\u003e {\n  const townRoot = resolveTownRoot();\n  \n  // NEW: Use rig-specific beads dir if rigPath provided\n  let beadsDir: string;\n  if (options.rigPath) {\n    beadsDir = resolveBeadsDir(options.rigPath);\n  } else {\n    beadsDir = resolveBeadsDir(townRoot);\n  }\n  \n  // ... rest of function\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Backend: beads.ts route\n\n**File:** `backend/src/routes/beads.ts`\n\n**Add rig path resolution (before line 20):**\n```typescript\n// Map rig names to their beads directories\nconst RIG_PATHS: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e = {\n  'gastown_boy': '/Users/will/Projects/Saults/gastown-boy',\n  'gastown': '/Users/will/gt/gastown',\n  // Add more rigs as needed\n};\n\n// In the GET handler:\nconst rigPath = rig ? RIG_PATHS[rig] : undefined;\n\nconst result = await listBeads({\n  ...(rig \u0026\u0026 { rig }),\n  ...(rigPath \u0026\u0026 { rigPath }),  // NEW\n  ...(typeParam \u0026\u0026 { type: typeParam }),\n  status,\n  limit,\n});\n```\n\n**Alternative:** Make rig paths configurable via environment or config file.\n\n### 3. Frontend: BeadsList.tsx\n\n**File:** `frontend/src/components/beads/BeadsList.tsx`\n\n**Add import (near line 1-20):**\n```typescript\nimport { useRigFilter } from '../../contexts/RigContext';\n```\n\n**Add hook usage (near line 140):**\n```typescript\nconst { selectedRig } = useRigFilter();\n```\n\n**Update usePolling call (line 144-149):**\n```typescript\nconst {\n  data: beads,\n  loading,\n  error,\n  refresh,\n} = usePolling\u003cBeadInfo[]\u003e(\n  () =\u003e api.beads.list({ \n    status: statusFilter, \n    type: 'task', \n    limit: 50,\n    rig: selectedRig ?? undefined  // NEW: pass selected rig\n  }),\n  { interval: 30000, enabled: isActive }\n);\n```\n\n**Add selectedRig to refresh dependency (around line 175):**\n```typescript\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n  void refresh();\n}, [statusFilter, selectedRig, refresh]);  // Add selectedRig\n```\n\n---\n\n## Existing Infrastructure (No Changes Needed)\n\n- `RigContext.tsx` - Already provides `selectedRig` state\n- `RigFilter.tsx` - Already renders dropdown in header\n- `api.beads.list()` - Already accepts `rig` parameter\n- `bd-client.ts` - Already supports `BEADS_DIR` env var\n\n---\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Select 'gastown_boy' in RigFilter → should see gb-* beads\n2. Select 'gastown' in RigFilter → should see gt-* beads  \n3. Select 'All Rigs' → should see hq-* town beads\n4. Verify polling refreshes when rig selection changes\n\n---\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `backend/src/services/beads-service.ts` | Add rigPath option, resolve rig-specific beads dir |\n| `backend/src/routes/beads.ts` | Map rig names to paths, pass rigPath to service |\n| `frontend/src/components/beads/BeadsList.tsx` | Use useRigFilter, pass selectedRig to API |","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-16T19:16:04.997105-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-16T19:58:20.4845-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T19:58:20.484513-06:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone.

Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress?

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads. Don't infer state from PID/tmux.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-16T21:04:21.338275-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-16T21:04:21.338276-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gb-wisp-sgd","depends_on_id":"gb-wisp-73h","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-16T21:04:21.345521-06:00","created_by":"gastown_boy/witness"}]}
